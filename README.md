# Introduction

This repository will describe the process of designing and building an open source 3D printer designed in Autodesk Inventor 2018. I am aware that Autodesk Inventor is not open source, but when the first version is ready, I will put STEP files in this repo so that everyone can edit the files.

**Some specs:**
 -  Print volume: 200x200x300 mm
 -  Frame size: 390x400x500 mm

# Planning

 -  Finish 3D design
 -  Build the printer
 -  Test the printer
 -  Optional: redesign parts and upgrade the printer
 -  Implement a Raspberry Pi
 -  Implement speech recognition, so that the printer can be controlled by voice

# Current status

The first prototype is almost ready to be tested. Currently, the X-carriage has to be redesigned because the 3D printed carriage wat not able to withstand the pulling force of the belts.
